# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
#This project compares the Isolation Forest and LocalOutlierFactor algorithms (anomaly detection algorithms) 
#for credit card detection. In this project the Isolation Forest algorithm provides better precision and recall for fraud cases
#compared to the LocalOutlier Factors 

#The dataset used for the project can be found https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data 

#For compution resources purposes, we will use only 20% of the data for this project however you can 
#use the entire data
